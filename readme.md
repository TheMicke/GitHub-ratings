# GitHub Ratings

Was supposed to give the possibility to rate GitHub profiles. 
Decided to just keep the "give hearts" function... Much nicer that way..

## Getting Started

1. npm install
2. npm run start (or npm run restart for further development)
3. open another terminal and go to project root
4. cd client
5. npm run start
